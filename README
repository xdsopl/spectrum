spectrum ist written from scratch and is held deliberately simple.
this means you have to look into the source and change the code to your needs.

you will find 2 implementations for spectral analysis:
- the STFT (short time fourier transform) for equispaced frequency bins.
- the CQT (constant q transform) for logarithmically spaced frequency bins.
please read "An efficient algorithm for the calculation of a constant Q transform" by Judith C. Brown and Miller S. Puckette.

with time i will add some more luxuries but for the moment:
- you can press SPACE to pause.
- you can press l to toggle linear / logarithmic power view
- you can press o to toggle linear / logarithmic frequency view
- you can press n to toggle view normalization
- you can press r to toggle rainbow colors / black white gradient
- you can open alsa devices and 16bit wav files.
- you can trade time resolution with frequency resolution by changing the parameter to the gauss window.

compile everything:
# make

look at spectrum of an audio file:
# ./spectrum audio.wav

look at spectrum recorded from default alsa device:
# ./spectrum

look at spectrum recorded from alsa device plughw:0,0:
# ./spectrum plughw:0,0
