spectrum ist written from scratch and is held deliberately simple.
this means you have to look into the source and change the code to your needs.

with time i will add some more luxuries but for the moment:
- you can press SPACE to pause.
- you can press c to toggle rms compression.
- you can press n to toggle view normalization
- you can press l to toggle linear / logarithmic view
- you can press r to toggle rainbow colors / black white gradient
- you can open alsa devices and 16bit wav files.
- you can trade time resolution with frequency resolution by changing the parameter to the gauss window.

here an example that shows the header of an Robot36 encoded image,
with normalized logarithmic view:

and with normalized linear view:

compile everything:
# make

look at spectrum of an audio file:
# ./spectrum audio.wav

look at spectrum recorded from default alsa device:
# ./spectrum

look at spectrum recorded from alsa device plughw:0,0:
# ./spectrum plughw:0,0
